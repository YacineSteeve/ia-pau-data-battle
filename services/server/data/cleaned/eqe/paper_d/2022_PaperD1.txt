General comments:
Candidates are reminded that they should pay attention to the way questions are asked and should not simply repeat information form the paper in the answer. Repeating information per se is not awarded any marks. Alternative answers, one being correct and one being wrong, for the markers to choose from do not attract any marks. In part I, full marks are only rewarded when the full legal basis was cited to support the analysis; candidates lost many marks due to incomplete legal basis. Citing only the legal basis or repeating the text therefrom without any further explanation, reasoning or providing advice generally does not attract any marks. However, alternative relevant legal basis not mentioned in the model solution also attracted marks. It is noted in this respect that the online examination with direct access to part of the syllabus in electronic form, appears to be seen as an invitation to copy articles, rules and paragraphs from the guidelines, for which full marks are only awarded if apart from the copied text, also the explanation is provided in view of the situation in the question.



Question 1:
European patent application EP-F was filed in January 2017 by applicant F. The EPO issued a communication under Article 94(3) EPC dated 1 September 2020 and which sets a time limit of four months. Thereafter no acts, including the payment of fees, were performed with respect to EP-F. Since applicant F did not reply to the communication, the EPO issued a communication dated 4 March 2021 notifying a loss of rights under Rule 112(1) EPC. Despite exercising all due care required by the circumstances, applicant F only became aware of the notification of loss of rights on 3 February 2022. Which steps need to be performed to ensure that the prosecution of EP-F continues? By when do these steps have to be performed?

Answer:
The time limit to apply for further processing under Article 121(1) and Rule 135(1) EPC already expired on 4 March +10 days (Rule 126(2) EPC) + 2 months (Rule 135(1) EPC) = 14 May 2021 (Fri). Thus, EP-F is deemed to be withdrawn, Article 94(4) EPC. It is possible to request re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for further processing, Article 122(1) EPC and Rule 136(3) EPC. The request has to be filed within two months of the removal of the cause of non-compliance, Rule 136(1) EPC, i.e. two months after 3 February 2022, i.e. at the latest on 3 April 2022 (Sun), extended to 4 April 2022 (Mon), Rule 134(1) EPC. This is still within the one year period from 14 May 2021. Thus the request has to be filed at the latest on 4 April 2022. In addition to filing the request for re-establishment of rights, applicant F has to pay the prescribed fee, Rule 136(1) EPC, state the grounds and facts on which the request is based or state that all due care was observed, Rule 136(2) EPC, and has to complete the omitted acts by requesting further processing under Article 121(1) and Rule 135(1) EPC by paying the prescribed fee and replying to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC. The time limit for replying to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC expired on 11 January 2021 (Mon). Two renewal fees (in respect of the 5th and the 6th year) were due on 31 January 2021 and 31 January 2022, respectively, Article 86(1) and Rule 51(1) EPC. This is after a loss of right. Therefore the renewal fees are due on the date of the notification of the decision re-establishing the rights. The renewal fees can still be paid within 4 months of the notification of the decision, Rule 51(4)(a) EPC, without an additional fee, or within 6 months of the decision with an additional fee, Rule 51(4)(a) and 51(2) EPC.

Examiner's report:
Most of the candidates realized that the time limit to reply to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC and the time limit for applying for further processing already expired and a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for further processing has to be made to further prosecute the application. Few candidates recognized the need to pay the renewal fees for the 5th and 6th year that became due on the date of notification of the decision re-establishing the rights and that the provisions of Rule 51(4)a) EPC applied.



Question 2:
On 22 February 2019 applicant B filed a European patent application EP-B in English with 15 claims. The European Patent Bulletin mentioned the publication of the European search report in August 2020. In the examination phase, applicant B filed an amended set of 16 claims. On 12 November 2021 the Examining Division issued a communication informing applicant B that it intended to grant a patent based on EP-B with these 16 claims. Since this communication, no acts have been performed by or on behalf of applicant B. Today you receive a phone call from applicant B asking you to correct before the EPO a spelling mistake in one of these 16 claims, the correction of which is obvious. Furthermore, applicant B wants the European patent based on EP-B to be granted as soon as possible and to take effect in the Netherlands. What steps have to be taken and by when?

Answer:
The communication issued by the EPO on 12 November 2021 was a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC. The following acts need to be carried out by 22 March 2022 (Tue) (12 November 2021 + 10 days (Rule 126(2) EPC) + 4 months (Rule 71(3) EPC) = 22 March 2022): File a request to correct the spelling mistake in one of the claims and additionally file a reasoned statement, why the correction satisfies the requirement of Rule 139 EPC, Guidelines C-V, 4.3; request PACE and reply as soon as possible to the second communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, OJ 2015, A93, C.15; immediately after receiving the second communication under Rule 71(3) EPC according to Rule 71(6) EPC, pay the fee for grant and publishing and file a translation of claims 1-16 in German and French, Rule 71(3) EPC; pay one claim fee for claim 16, Rule 71(4) EPC, before or immediately after receiving the second communication under Rule 71(3) EPC; pay the renewal fee for the fourth year with an additional fee of 50% of the renewal fee for the fourth year, Rule 51(2) EPC, within 6 months of the due date, i.e. until 31 August 2022: 28 February 2022 (last day of Feb) + 6 months (Rule 51(2) EPC, J4/91) = 31 August 2022 (Wed). Only after all of the fees are paid, the decision to grant the European patent is issued, Rule 71a(1) EPC, and the mention of the grant of the European patent is published. To have the European patent based on EP-B take effect in the Netherlands, file a translation only of the claims in Dutch, Article 1(2) and Article 1(3) of the London Agreement, and pay the special fee, National Law relating to the EPC, IV., column 5 for NL, under Article 65(2) EPC. Both actions need to be performed within 3 months from the date on which the mention of the grant is published in the European Patent Bulletin, Article 65(1) and National Law relating to the EPC, IV., columns 4 and 5 for NL.

Examiner's report:
Most of the candidates proposed requesting a correction of the spelling mistake. Fewer realized that a request for correction under Rule 139 EPC triggers the procedure under Rule 71(6) EPC. Some of the candidates still requested to waive the right to receive a further communication under Rule 71(3) EPC (waiver option) without expressing the applicant’s agreement to the text to be granted. However, the EPO does not process these waivers any more. Some candidates suggested to approve the text as proposed for grant with the first communication under Rule 71(3) EPC and thereafter to request the correction of the spelling mistake while EP-B is still pending. This approach would lead to a further delay of the conclusion of the grant procedure of EP-B contrary to the wish of the applicant. Full points were also attributed to candidates who suggested expressing the applicant’s agreement to the text to be granted immediately after receiving the second communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, if the translations of the corrected claims and the fee for grant and publishing had already been filed and paid respectively in reply to the first communication under Rule 71(3) EPC. Many candidates overlooked paying the renewal fee for the fourth year.



Question 3:
Chinese company C filed an international application PCT-C on 26 May 2020 with the Chinese Patent Office (CNIPA) as receiving Office. PCT-C was filed in English without claiming priority. The only claim of PCT-C pertains to subject-matter C1, and its description discloses subject-matter C1 and subject-matter C2. Subject-matter C1 and subject-matter C2 are not linked by a single general inventive concept. The international search report (ISR) was established by CNIPA on subject-matter C1.
1. Company C would like to have a supplementary international search report (SISR) established by the EPO.
(a) What should be done to request the SISR for subject-matter C1?
(b) Can the SISR cover subject-matter C2?
2. After the SISR is established by the EPO on subject-matter C1, PCT-C enters the European phase as Euro-PCT-C. Company C would like to obtain protection in Europe for subject-matter C2 instead. Can Euro-PCT-C be examined for subject- matter C2?

Answer:
1.(a): The supplementary international search report, SISR, may be requested within 22 months from the filing date, Rule 45bis.1(a) PCT, i.e. until 28 March 2022 (26 May 2020 (Thu) + 22 months (Rule 45bis.1(a) PCT) = 26 March 2022 (Sat) extended to 28 March 2022 (Mon) (Rule 80.5 PCT)). The request shall be filed at the International Bureau, Rule 45bis.1(b) PCT. Both the supplementary search handling fee, Rule 45bis.2(a) PCT, and the supplementary search fee, Rule 45bis.3(a) PCT, are to be paid to the International Bureau, Rule 45bis.2(c) PCT and Rule 45bis.3(b) PCT, within one month of the date of the receipt of the supplementary search request, Rule 45bis.2(c) PCT and Rule 45bis.3(c) PCT.
1.(b): No SISR can be established for C2, as the basis for the SISR is the set of claims as filed, Rule 45bis.5(b) PCT.
2. Since the EPO drew up the SISR, no supplementary European search report will be established, Article 153(7) EPC and Guidelines B-II, 4.3.1. However C may and must amend the claims so as to claim C2, upon entry into European phase or in response to a communication under to Rule 161(1) EPC. The EPO will issue an invitation to pay an additional fee pursuant to Rule 164(2)(a) EPC. Provided C pays the additional fee, C2 can be searched and examined pursuant to Rule 164(2) EPC.

Examiner's report:
Most of the candidates realized that no supplementary international search report can be established for C2, as its basis is the set of claims as filed, and that C2 can be the subject of a supplementary European search and can be examined under the provision of Rule 164(2) EPC.



Question 4:
Applicant D filed European patent application EP-D1 in January 2019. EP-D1 discloses a new raw material D1 and a method for obtaining it. EP-D1 was withdrawn in April 2019. In March 2019, applicant D filed European patent application EP-D2 disclosing a method for producing a new product D2 starting from the raw material D1. EP-D2 does not teach how to obtain the raw material D1. Instead, the description of EP-D2 merely refers to the relevant part of EP-D1. In February 2020, applicant D filed European patent application EP-D3 claiming priority from EP-D2. EP-D3 claims the same product D2 as disclosed in EP-D2. EP-D3 discloses the same method for producing D2, but from raw material D3. Raw material D3 has been available to the public since 2019. Applicant D becomes aware of European patent application EP-D4, which was filed in January 2020 by a different applicant and published in July 2021. EP-D4 discloses product D2 and a method for producing D2 from raw material D3, the method being identical to the one disclosed in EP-D3.
(a) Does EP-D2 sufficiently disclose product D2?
(b) Is the subject-matter of the claim to product D2 in EP-D3 novel?

Answer:
(a) EP-D1 was not made available to the public before or on the publication date of EP-D2, because EP-D1 was withdrawn in due time before its publication, Rule 67(2) EPC. Therefore, the relevant content of EP-D1, i.e. the method for obtaining raw material D1, is not to be considered as forming part of the content of EP-D2 for the disclosure of the invention, Guidelines F-III, 8 in combination with H-IV, 2.2.1. The disclosure of EP-D2 does not enable the skilled person to carry out the method for producing product D2 starting from raw material D1. Therefore, EP-D2 does not sufficiently disclose product D2, Article 83 EPC.
(b) EP-D3 is not entitled to the priority date of EP-D2, because EP-D2 does not sufficiently disclose product D2, Case Law II.D.3.1.6, because an essential element (i.e. the method for obtaining D2 starting from D1) is neither expressly disclosed nor directly and unambiguously implied in EP-D2, as it is not part of the content of EP-D2. EP-D4 and EP-D3 are sufficiently disclosed, because EP-D4 and EP-D3 describe a method for producing D2 from D3 and D3 was part of the state of the art for EP-D4 and EP-D3. EP-D4 is filed before EP-D3 but published after and is prior art pursuant to Article 54(3) EPC. Therefore the subject-matter of the claim of EP-D3 is not novel in view of EP-D4.

Examiner's report:
Several candidates came to the right conclusion that EP-D3 was not entitled to the priority date of EP-D2. However, many of them did not realize and/or provide the correct legal basis why the disclosure of EP-D2 does not enable the skilled person to carry out the method for producing product D2 starting from raw material D1. Even fewer candidates explicitly stated that D2 is sufficiently disclosed in EP-D4.



Question 5:
On 2 June 2020 company E filed European patent application EP-E claiming a composition comprising 5-40% of compound E1. EP-E claims the priority of a previous patent application JP-E filed with the Japan Patent Office by company E on 30 May 2019. JP-E discloses a composition comprising 10-20% of the compound E1. The examiner cited an article disclosing a composition comprising 40% of the compound E1 and published in December 2017. When analysing the technical teaching of the article, the skilled person would immediately recognise that the disclosure is erroneous and that the only possible correction would be a composition comprising 15% of the compound E1. Is the article novelty-destroying for the subject-matter claimed in EP-E?

Answer:
EP-E was filed within the priority period, which was extended from 30 May 2020 (Sat) through 1 June 2020 (Whit Monday) to 2 June 2020 (Tue) and the EPO's filing offices in Germany were closed from 30 May to 1 June 2020, Rule 134(1) EPC. Hence, the effective date for the composition comprising E1 in the range [10-20%] is the filing date of the priority document JP-E and the effective date for E1 being within [5-10%[ or ]20-40%] is the filing date of EP-E, G1/15. The skilled person can see at once that the disclosure of the article contains errors, i.e. a composition comprising 40% of E1, and can identify what the only possible correction should be, i.e. a composition comprising 15% of E1. Hence, the article can be considered to contain the correction when assessing its relevance to patentability, i.e. it discloses a composition comprising 15% of E1, Guidelines G-IV, 9. The article forms prior art under Article 54(2) EPC only for the subject-matter not entitled to priority, G3/93, i.e. the composition comprising E1 in the range [5-10%[ or ]20-40%]. Therefore the article is not novelty destroying, because it discloses an embodiment of a composition comprising 15% of E1, which falls within the range [10-20%] of E1, being entitled to the right of priority.

Examiner's report:
Empty



Question 6:
European patent EP-A was granted with independent claim 1 directed to apparatus A1 and independent claim 2 directed to apparatus A2. Consider the following situations independently:
Situation 1: An admissible opposition was filed based on document D1. D1 is prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC and discloses apparatus A1 only. The sole opponent withdrew the opposition the day after the opposition period expired.
(a) How will the opposition proceedings continue?
(b) What can the patent proprietor do to address the lack of novelty?
Situation 2: An admissible opposition was rejected. The sole opponent filed an appeal together with a document D1. D1 is prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC and discloses apparatus A1 only. The opposition was subsequently withdrawn.
(c) How will the appeal proceedings continue?
(d) What steps can be taken before the EPO to address the lack of novelty?

Answer:
Situation 1:
(a) The opposition division will continue the proceedings of its own motion, Article 114(1) EPC and Rule 84(2) EPC, when the opposition is withdrawn, because the stage reached in the opposition proceedings is as in Guidelines D-VII, 5.3 and 5.2. Namely, the proceedings are likely to result in a limitation or revocation of EP-A without further assistance of the opponent and without the opposition division itself having to undertake extensive investigations in view of document D1 being prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC and being novelty destroying for claim 1. The opposition division will inform the patent proprietor that the opposition proceedings are continued, Guidelines-D-VII, 5.2.
(b) Because the opposition is still pending, the proprietor should file an amendment limiting the claims to claim 2 only, which is occasioned by the ground of opposition under Article 100a EPC, Rule 80 EPC. Hence, EP-A will be maintained as amended, Article 101(3)(a) EPC.
Situation 2:
(c) The opponent is the sole appellant. If an opposition is withdrawn by the sole opponent-appellant during appeal proceedings, the withdrawal of the opposition is interpreted as withdrawal of the appeal, G8/93. The withdrawal of the appeal terminates the appeal proceedings, and the first instance decision becomes final.
(d) The opposition / appeal proceedings are not pending anymore and therefore limitation is possible, Article 105a(2) EPC and Rule 93(1) EPC. In order to address the lack of novelty in view of D1, the patent proprietor should request limitation by performing the acts according to Article 105a(1) EPC and Rule 92 EPC, in particular submit amended claims limited to claim 2, Rule 92(2)(d) EPC, and pay the fee for limitation, Article105a(1) EPC.

Examiner's report:
Many candidates realized the asymmetry between opposition and appeal proceedings in relation to the continuation of the opposition proceedings ex officio. However, few candidates realized that the opposition and appeal proceedings are not pending any more in situation 2, and that limitation is possible under Article 105a(2) EPC to address the lack of novelty in view of D1. Likewise, few candidates realized that the withdrawal of the opposition by the sole opponent-appellant is interpreted as withdrawal of the appeal, and that the correct legal basis for this conclusion is G8/93.
