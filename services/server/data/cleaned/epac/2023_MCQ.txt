Question 2:
On 10 October 2021, European patent attorney X filed European patent application EP-A with the EPO on the applicant's behalf. Application EP-A was published on 12 April 2023, together with the extended European search report. On 6 October 2023, the applicant contacts a new European patent attorney Y to replace X as representative and issues Y with its instructions to reply to the extended European search report. The applicant did not inform X that he would be replaced. What are the steps necessary to validly appoint representative Y and to avoid any loss of rights for European patent application EP-A?

C. New representative Y requests a change of representative and files a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 23 October 2023 at the latest.
D. New representative Y requests a change of representative, files a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 23 October 2023 at the latest and files in good time an authorisation signed by the applicant.

Answer:
A. New representative Y requests a change of representative, files a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 12 October 2023 at the latest and files in good time an authorisation signed by the applicant.

Legal basis:
Representative X is a representative according to article 134.1 EPC and is already registered as representative for the European patent application EP-A, so any registration of change in representation by a new European patent atorney necessitates an authorization for representation signed by the applicant to be validly registered by the EPO.
According to rule 152(1) EPC, The President of the European Patent Oﬃce shall determine the cases in which a signed authorization shall be ﬁled by representatives acting before the European Patent Oﬃce. In decision of the President of the EPO of 12.07.2007 on the ﬁling of authorizations (Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1), (2) If the European Patent Oﬃce is informed of a change of representative involving professional representatives who are not members of the same association, without being notiﬁed that the previous representative's authorization has terminated, the new representative must ﬁle, together with the notiﬁcation of his appointment, an individual authorization (original and one copy) or a reference to a general authorization already on ﬁle. If an authorization for representation is not provided, any acts done by the “new” representative will be deemed to never have occurred by the EPO. R 152(6) Representative Y shall ﬁle a change in representation with form 5060 to register before the EPO as the new representative, an authorization of representation signed by the applicant for the change in representation to be valid and a response to the writen opinion before the EPO before:
Time limit to respond to the negative search opinion: publication date of the EESR: 
12 April 2023 + 6 months (R 70a(1) + R 70(1) EPC) = 12 October 2023 (Tuesday)

Question 14:
The opposition division revoked European patent EP-B1. The patent proprietor filed an appeal in time. The board of appeal forwarded a copy of the appeal to the opponent/respondent with a communication dated 1 June 2023 giving it an opportunity to file comments within a period of four months. The opponent/respondent files comments today, 12 October 2023. What further action has to be taken?
A.The opponent/respondent needs to request an extension of the period for comment.
B.The opponent/respondent needs to pay a fee for further processing.
C.The opponent/respondent needs to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and pay the associated fee.
D.None of the above.

Answer:
D.None of the above.

Legal basis:
An extension must be requested before expiry of the period for responding not the case here. Further processing is only available to applicants (and thus before grant). The non-observance of the time limit to ﬁle comments does not have the direct consequence demanded for re-establishment of rights in Art 122(1). [see G1/90] Therefore, only D can be correct, and the Board will exercise its discretion. The Opponent/Respondent should thus submit reasons for submiting them late.



Question 15:
A European patent application was filed on 20 March 2020. Proceedings were interrupted under Rule 142 EPC on 10 March 2022. The applicant was informed that proceedings would be resumed today, 12 October 2023. No renewal fee has been paid so far. Which of the following statements is correct?
A. As no renewal fees have been paid, the application is deemed to be withdrawn.
B. The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on 12 October 2023 at the latest.
C. The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest.
D. The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31 October 2023 at the latest.

Answer:
B. The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on 12 October 2023 at the latest.

Legal basis:
Guidelines, E-Vii.1.5 Concerning renewal fees falling due during the period of interruption,
Rule 142(4) has to be interpreted as deferring the due date for their payment until the date the proceedings are resumed (J 902/87). Thus, such renewal fees may be paid without additional fee at the date of resumption and in the amounts applicable on that date. They may also be paid within six months of said date, provided that an additional fee is also paid within said period (Rule 51(2)).
